    <h2>Compressibility</h2>
    This file system is highly compressable and can be compressed via algorithms like
    gzip, very efficiently. Even a basic single character repetetion based compression
    algorithm can compress it significantly. This is due to high amounts of null in the
    file system. This ability can be used to compress the file system
    for long term storage or transport over internet.

    <h2>Intended Applications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Software Updates</li>
        <li>Container Based Platforms like Docker</li>
        <li>One easy way to package game assets into a single file that is readable and writable inplace.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tools Provided</h2>
    BVFS comes with a handfull of tools to fix common issues and inspect the file system.
    Here is a comprehensive list of them
    
    <h3>BVFSDump</h3>
    Dumps all the block headers and block related informations to the standard output.
    This can be used for debugging while developing the file system. It does not dump
    the actual file data.

    <h3>BVFSFix</h3>
    Fixes common issues like failed lock, dangling pointers, hanging blocks.
